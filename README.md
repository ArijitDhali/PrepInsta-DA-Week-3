# PrepInsta Winter Internship - Week 3 

## Overview
Week 3 of the PrepInsta Winter Internship was centered around data cleaning, exploration, and manipulation using Pandas in Python. The primary focus was on analyzing a Chipotle dataset to ensure data integrity, standardization, and consistency for further analysis.

## Assignment Summary
The assignments undertaken in Week 3 encompassed a comprehensive exploration of the Chipotle dataset, involving various data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis tasks:

### Data Cleaning Tasks
1. **Missing Values Handling:**
   - Identified missing values in columns (Order ID, Quantity, Item Name, Choice Description, Item Price) and proposed strategies for handling them.
   
2. **Data Types Verification:**
   - Verified the data types of each column and recommended adjustments where necessary for alignment with expected types.

3. **Duplicated Entries Management:**
   - Identified and managed duplicated entries within the dataset, discussing their potential impacts on analysis.

4. **Quantity and Item Price Examination:**
   - Examined Quantity and Item Price columns for inconsistencies or anomalies requiring correction.
   
5. **Choice Description Analysis:**
   - Explored the Choice Description column, addressing the handling of multiple descriptions for a single item.

6. **Special Character Handling:**
   - Checked for special characters in text-based columns and proposed strategies for achieving consistency.

7. **Order ID Integrity Verification:**
   - Cross-referenced the Order ID column for irregularities or patterns necessitating validation.

8. **Item Name Standardization:**
   - Standardized the Item Name column by unifying variations for enhanced analysis.

9. **Quantity and Price Relationships Investigation:**
   - Explored relationships between Quantity and Item Price, assessing the need for adjustments.

10. **Data Integrity Check:**
    - Ensured the alignment of quantities and prices with corresponding items and descriptions for integrity.

### Additional Tasks
- **Handling Categorical Data:**
  - Encoded or transformed categorical columns, like Item Name, for suitable analysis.
  
- **Quantity and Price Units Consistency:**
  - Ensured uniformity in Quantity and Item Price units, considering necessary conversions or adjustments.

## Conclusion
Week 3's assignments provided an in-depth understanding of data cleaning methodologies and best practices using Pandas in Python. The tasks undertaken were foundational in preparing the Chipotle dataset for subsequent analysis, ensuring its accuracy, consistency, and reliability.
